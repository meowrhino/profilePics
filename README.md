# profilePics

I love to upload images that I think that represent me to my Telegram profile, and from time to time I like to see them and find patterns and changes in time, today I found out that the first one was lost due to the 100 max photos limit (Telegram did not notify me that the first one would be lost) so I wanted to create an archive to save them forever and be able to store more than just a couple of them
